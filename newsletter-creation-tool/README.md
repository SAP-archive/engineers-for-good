# Engineers for Good

This repository was created as part of the engineers for good program during the academy for engineering cohort 20/21.
The task was to create a react web application that facilitates the creation of newsletters for project partner [Goodmarket](https://www.goodmarket.global/).
The application uses public API's of Goodmarket to fetch content (text and images) and embeds this content in a html e-mail template.
